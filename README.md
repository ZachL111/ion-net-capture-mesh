# ion-net-capture-mesh

`ion-net-capture-mesh` treats networking as a local verification problem. The TypeScript implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Ion Net Capture Mesh Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## Useful Pieces

- Includes extended examples for retry behavior, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents policy decisions tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## What This Is For

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `package.json`: Node package scripts

## Architecture Notes

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The TypeScript project keeps types close to the model and compiles before running its checks.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Case Study

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Scope

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Expansion Ideas

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more networking fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Tooling

The only required setup is the local TypeScript toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.
